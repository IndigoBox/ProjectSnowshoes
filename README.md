# Project Snowshoes
Redefining the Windows interface for everybody...and the actual word "Snowshoes" apparently.

Welcome, friends, family, colleagues, dogs that run around the studio, and random prowling bots! This is the first commit for Project Snowshoes, a project that previously had its code privately held for a year and a half. Now, anything that gets done can actually be seen here. 

#What am I looking at?
There are two things that Project Snowshoes needs: the main program that controls and manages everything, and dependencies as well as bundled programs that get installed when the client runs through the SnowshoesInstaller (sorry, no repo for that, but I promise you are not missing much there). 

So, if you are looking for the main program code, go directly to the ProjectSnowshoes directory.
If you are looking for various other resources, go to ClientSide.
<b>NOTE</b>: You WILL need the ClientSide resources to run a compiled version of what is in the ProjectSnowshoes directory. Save ClientSide and place it in C:, renaming it to "ProjectSnowshoes". I'll be cleaning the way all of this reads soon once The Bridge (the current build) is finally released.  

If somebody else has a better name or way to organize all of this, just let me know. You can even send me an email...it's listed on my profile.

#A little note from the editor
Just because this is going live, the craziness might not stop. If you look through the code, you might see that some of the method names and whatnot are absolutely disgusting. I know...I look back at them as well, and they are difficult to interpret. While I am actually compiling a document to decode some of the more confusing names and references used in method/instance names, etc., things will get better now that this moved on from something I do at three in the morning to becoming an official IndigoBox (/Pentelec) project that I work on at three in the morning.

Thank you for visiting, and may this be the start of an ever-developing, fun, and successful journey!
