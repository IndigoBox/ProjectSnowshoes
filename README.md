# ProjectSnowshoes
Redefining the Windows interface for everybody...and the actual word "Snowshoes" apparently.

Welcome, friends, family, colleagues, dogs that run around the studio, and random prowling bots! This is the first commit for Project Snowshoes, a project that previously had its code privately held for a year and a half. Now, anything that gets done can actually be seen here. 

A little note: just because this is going live, the craziness might not stop. If you look through the code, you might see that some of the method names and whatnot are absolutely disgusting. I know...I look back at them as well, and they are difficult to interpret. While I am actually compiling a document to decode some of the more confusing names and references used in method/instance names, etc., things will get better now that this moved on from something I do at three in the morning to becoming an official IndigoBox (/Pentelec) project that I work on at three in the morning.

Thank you for visiting, and may this be the start of an ever-developing, fun, and successful journey!
